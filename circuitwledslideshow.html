    <li>For the keyframes, you need to do some math. It's (pics * 2) / 100. Use this as the multipler for each slide, with "100%" being the last keyframe. Each image needs to have multiple keyframes in order for the slideshow to "pause" on that image. I used two stops for each slide, hence "pics * 2". Notice how the last keyframe at 100% is also the position of the first image of the slideshow. So technically, the first image gets 3 keyframes. I hope this makes sense.
